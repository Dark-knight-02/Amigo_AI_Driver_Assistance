# Amigo_AI_Driver_Assistance
In this project I'm trying to make a AI based driver assistance system which can be deployed in autonomous cars.
Currently there are three main parts in this project

1. Lane Detection System
2. Face Recognition System
3. Adaptive Syspension System

Description regarding all the parts are given in their README.md files respectively
