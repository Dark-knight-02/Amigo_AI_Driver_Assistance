# Adaptive Suspension System
Here I am trying to develop an adaptive suspension system that could adjust the suspension stiffness of a vehicle based on the road ahead and also the mood of the passenger inside.
 I am still trying to figure out the possibilities of this system and am still learning about the methods to implement it effectively.
### Currently my idea is as follows:
In the particular context of Indian roads we are nowadays having the issue that vehicles which have a hard suspension system will offer better stability but 
for the passengers using the particular vehicle in bumpy indian roads have very less comfort travelling in it.
And while talking about the vehicles which have a soft suspension and provide better comfort,
it becomes more risky to travel at higher speeds due to its less stability because of high chance of roll over.
The suspen system also has a great role in maintaining the ground clearance.

Here I am trying to develop a system to control the suspension which can be added to vehicles with AI inside it.

The system will collect the data from the radars and high precision cameras attached with it and will detect the condition of the road,
mainly the smoothness of the road ahead. It will also use data collected from the GPS to know about the turns ahead.
The collected data will be then used to adjust the stiffness of suspension and elevation of the vehicle by the system.
One important thing to be concerned about here is that we cannot use conventional suspension systems here and we need to use electromagnetic
suspension as its stiffness can be controlled while on the run.

By the implementation of this system we can design suspension systems which offer better comfort without any compromise in stability and vice versa.
