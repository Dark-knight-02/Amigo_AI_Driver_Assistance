# Face Recognition
Here I am developing a Facial Identification system using Haar Cascade Classifier and KNN algorithm to identify the driver.

This system can be used in an AI based driver assistance system to recognize the driver and unlock the car accordingly. 
Further moving on it is possible to set up personalised UI settings based on a particular driver.

#### Future Plan

I'm working to deploy an algorithm to identify the mood of the passenger and make adjustments in the UI. 
In case of an Autonomous vehicle the same algorithm with some modifications can also be utilised to adjust the speed and handling of the vehicle.
